# Pytorch Graph Attention Network

This is a pytorch implementation of the Graph Attention Network (GAT)
model presented by Veličković et. al (2017, https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903).

The repo has been forked initially from https://github.com/Diego999/pyGAT. The official repository for the GAT (Tensorflow) is available in https://github.com/PetarV-/GAT. Therefore, if you make advantage of the pyGAT model in your research, please cite the following:

# Performances

For the branch **master**, the training of the transductive learning on Cora task on a Titan Xp takes ~0.9 sec per epoch and 10-15 minutes for the whole training (~800 epochs). The final accuracy is between 84.2 and 85.3 (obtained on 5 different runs). For the branch **similar_impl_tensorflow**, the training takes less than 1 minute and reach ~83.0.

A small note about initial sparse matrix operations of https://github.com/tkipf/pygcn: they have been removed. Therefore, the current model take ~7GB on GRAM.


# Requirements

Torch-GAT relies on Python 3.5 and PyTorch 0.4.1 (due to torch.sparse_coo_tensor).
